# Playlister

This project is based on a CodeCademy project that allows a user to create a playlist by using Spotify's API, and saving a playlist directly to the user's Spotify account. This project has been reworked from the original CodeCademy project by using React hooks and using more semantic HTML tags for better accessibility in its near deployment future.

This is purely a front end application, and the project is still developing (making styling changes as well as adding new features).
